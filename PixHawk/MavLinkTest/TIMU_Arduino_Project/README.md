# TIMU Arduino Project

## Overview
The TIMU (Tele Inertial Measurement Unit) Arduino project is designed to interface with an autopilot system using MAVLink protocol. It logs MAVLink messages to an SD card and provides real-time communication with the autopilot.

## Setup Instructions
1. **Install Required Libraries**: Ensure that you have the necessary libraries installed for handling MAVLink messages, SD card access, and streaming. Refer to `libraries/required_libraries.txt` for the list of required libraries.

2. **Connect Hardware**: Connect the TIMU hardware to your Arduino board according to the specifications of your setup.

3. **Upload the Code**: Open `TIMU_Arduino_Project.ino` in the Arduino IDE and upload the code to your Arduino board.

4. **Monitor Output**: Use the Serial Monitor to view the output from the TIMU system and ensure that messages are being logged correctly.

## Usage Guidelines
- The project initializes serial communication at a baud rate of 921600.
- It sets up an SD card logger to store MAVLink messages.
- The main loop continuously reads messages from the autopilot interface and logs them to the SD card.
